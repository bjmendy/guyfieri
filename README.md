User stories:
The user should be able to log in and register with a
username and password that will be hashed and stored.
The user should be able to click working buttons taking
them to different pages like the register page and the login page.
The user should be able to click the buttons and feed the
tomagotchi and have an ability to lose.
The user can use the hamburger menu to see different restaurants
that have been endorsed by Guy Fieri, clickable links.
The user can see different taglines that are if/else statements
depending on how to user uses the game.

Some things I wish I had time to do:
I wanted to be able to have certain soundbytes play during
certain times and actions, I want to implement more features
that can kill the tomagotchi, I want to be able to add features
through Ruby where the username will pop up and there is a leader
board.
